Instalation
---------------
You need to include facets.js, vismaGris.css and the images folder.

Now, you can include the scripts by adding the following 
tags to the HEAD section of your HTML pages:

 <script src="/javascripts/prototype.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
 <script src="/javascripts/scriptaculous.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

scriptaculous.js will automatically load the other files of the 
script.aculo.us distribution in, provided they are accessible 
via the same path.
